# About Docker Compose & Use cases.
[1] with Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. 
Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

[2] Docker compose has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application

[3] What can docker compose do?
- Start, stop, and rebuild services
- View the status of running services
- Stream the log output of running services
- Run a one-off command on a service

[4] Key Features of Compose
- Have multiple isolated environments on a single host
- Preserves volume data when containers are created
- Only recreate containers that have changed
- Supports variables and moving a composition between environments

[5] Practice of Docker Compose

## Prerequisites
- Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose as standalone binaries
- Install Docker Desktop which includes both Docker Engine and Docker Compose
- You don’t need to install Python or Redis, as both are provided by Docker images.

## Step 1: Define the application dependencies

1.1 Create a directory for the project:
```
$ mkdir composetest
$ cd composetest
```

1.2 Create a file called “app.py” in your project directory
```
import time

import redis
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
cache = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6379)

def get_hit_count():
    retries = 5
    while True:
        try:
            return cache.incr('hits')
        except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError as exc:
            if retries == 0:
                raise exc
            retries -= 1
            time.sleep(0.5)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    count = get_hit_count()
    return 'Hello World! I have been seen {} times.\n'.format(count)
```
1.3 Create another file called “requirements.txt”
```
flask
redis
```
## Step 2: Create a Dockerfile

Dockerfile
```
FROM python:3.7-alpine
WORKDIR /code
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0
RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev linux-headers
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 5000
COPY . .
CMD ["flask", "run"]
```
This tells Docker to:
- Build an image starting with the Python 3.7 image.
- Set the working directory to /code.
- Set environment variables used by the flask command.
- Install gcc and other dependencies
- Copy requirements.txt and install the Python dependencies.
- Add metadata to the image to describe that the container is listening on port 5000
- Copy the current directory . in the project to the workdir . in the image.
- Set the default command for the container to flask run.

## Step 3: Define services in a Compose file🔗

Create a file with name docker-compose.yml and paste the following configurations:

```
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```
## Step 4: Build and run your app with Compose🔗

        docker compose up
