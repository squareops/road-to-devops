# Overview
Configuration management is a process for maintaining computer systems, servers, and software in a desired, consistent state. It’s a way to make sure that a system performs as it’s expected to as changes are made over time. 

Managing IT system configurations involves defining a system's desired state—like server configuration—then building and maintaining those systems. Closely related to configuration assessments and drift analyses, configuration management uses both to identify systems to update, reconfigure, or patch.

## Why manage configurations?
Configuration management keeps you from making small or large changes that go undocumented. Misconfigurations like these were identified in our State of Kubernetes Security report as a leading cause of security incidents among containerized or Kubernetes-orchestrated environments. 

Misconfigurations can lead to poor performance, inconsistencies, or noncompliance and negatively impact business operations and security. When undocumented changes are made across many systems and applications, it adds to instability and downtime.

Manually identifying systems that require attention, determining remediation steps, prioritizing actions, and validating completion are too complicated to perform in large environments. But without documentation, maintenance, and a change control process, system administrators and software developers could end up not knowing what’s on a server or which software has been updated.

Configuration management systems let you consistently define system settings, as well as build and maintain those systems according to those baseline settings. Configuration management helps users and administrators know where certain services exist and what the current state of applications are.

## Proper configuration management tools:
- Classify and manage systems by groups and subgroups. 
- Centrally modify base configurations.
- Roll out new settings to all applicable systems. 
- Automate system identification, patches, and updates
- Identify outdated, poor performing, and noncompliant configurations. 
- Prioritize actions. 
- Access and apply prescriptive remediation.

## Configuration management benefits
Think of it like this. If you keep up with the small things, you can avoid more complicated, expensive repairs in the future. Configuration management is about preventing issues so you don’t have to deal with as many problems later. 

For example, you can make sure that your test and production environments match. That way, you’ll have fewer problems with applications once they’ve been deployed than you would if these environments weren’t exactly the same.

With configuration management, you can accurately replicate an environment with the correct configurations and software because you know what exists in the original environment.

## Automating configuration management
The role of configuration management is to maintain systems in a desired state. Traditionally, this was handled manually or with custom scripting by system administrators. Automation is the use of software to perform tasks, such as configuration management, in order to reduce cost, complexity, and errors.

Through automation, a configuration management tool can provision a new server within minutes with less room for error. You can also use automation to maintain a server in the desired state, such as your standard operating environment (SOE), without the provisioning scripts needed previously.
